Now, you can choose from three sound profiles: Single Sound Profile, Repeated Sound Profile, and "Be Quiet" Profile[^1^]. You can also select a custom MP3 or WAV sound file for each task[^2^]. This way, you can have different sounds for different types of tasks, such as reminders, deadlines, birthdays, etc.
 
## Linking Tasks with Documents or Web Pages
 
Another useful feature that was added in this version is the ability to link tasks with documents or web pages[^1^]. You can also execute actions according to the start time of the task, such as opening a document or a web page[^2^]. This can help you access the relevant information or resources for your task quickly and easily.
 
## Task Printing and Exporting
 
If you want to print or export your tasks, you can do so using the built-in Print Preview window. You can choose from different layouts and formats for each calendar view[^1^]. You can also export your tasks to PDF, HTML, MHT, RTF, XLS, XLSX, CSV, TXT, BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, EMF, WMF[^1^]. This can be useful for sharing your tasks with others or for backup purposes.
 
## Task Grouping and Custom Categories
 
To help you organize your tasks better, you can use the task grouping and custom categories features. You can group your tasks by their status, category, year, month, week of year, or by any column combination using the group panel[^1^]. You can also define your own custom categories using the category editor[^1^]. This way, you can sort and filter your tasks according to your preferences.
 
## Calendar Scheduler
 
The calendar scheduler is a powerful component that lets you visualize your tasks in different views. You can choose from four views: Day Planner, Work Week Calendar, Week Calendar, and Month Calendar[^1^]. Each view has its own layout and printing capabilities.
